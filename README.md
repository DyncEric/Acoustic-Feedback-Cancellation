Adaptive Noise Injection Based Acoustic Feedback Cancellation

**Install Xcode to run it on local iPhone or mac processor.
**Runs on iPhone with iOS 10+ versions.

Install using .xcodeproj file.

**Privacy Note: Application records through your microphone. App does not save data nor save it, to process later..**

What is the application?
Purpose of the application is to demonstrate Acoustic Feedback Cancellation on smartphone devices.  Loudspeaker of the device playes the recorded sound
in real time and microphone again captures it, creating infinite feedback loop. Application uses Adaptive Noise Injection based Algorithm to tackle the feedback problem.
